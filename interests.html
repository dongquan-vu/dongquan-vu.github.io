<p> <b>COLONEL BLOTTO GAME</b> </p>: The Colonel Blotto game is a resources allocation game with a long-standing history (since 1921): Two players (often referred to as colonels) choose how to distribute a fixed budget of resources (often called troops or soldiers) on a number of battlefields. Each battlefield has a given value and is won by the player who allocates more resources to it; each player maximizes the sum of values of battlefields she wins. As a simple and elegant model for strategic resource allocation problems, the Colonel Blotto game (and in particular the characterization of its equilibrium) has important applications in many domains including security (allocation of defense/attacks resources), but also politics (allocation of campaign resources or lobbying resources), industrial operations (allocation of R&D resources) or advertisement (allocation of ad budgets).
