<p> <b>COLONEL BLOTTO GAME</b>: The Colonel Blotto game is a resources allocation game with a long-standing history (since 1921): Two players (often referred to as colonels) choose how to distribute a fixed budget of resources (often called troops or soldiers) on a number of battlefields. Each battlefield has a given value and is won by the player who allocates more resources to it; each player maximizes the sum of values of battlefields she wins. As a simple and elegant model for strategic resource allocation problems, the Colonel Blotto game (and in particular the characterization of its equilibrium) has important applications in many domains including security (allocation of defense/attacks resources), but also politics (allocation of campaign resources or lobbying resources), industrial operations (allocation of R&D resources) or advertisement (allocation of ad budgets).</p>


<p><b>Some Inspiring Quotes</b>:</p>
<ul>
	  <li> <i>Carl Sagan (From Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space)</i>: “Look again at that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. […] There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known.”</li>
    <li> <i>Brandon Sanderson (From Oathbringer): "To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one."</i></li>
